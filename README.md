## RecipeApp – Project Structure

This project is built using **SwiftUI** and targets **Xcode 26.2**, following a **modular MVVM + Coordinator** architecture.  
It emphasizes clean separation of concerns, testability via dependency injection, and flexibility between real API requests and local mock data.

## 🧭 Coordinator

**Coordinator/**

- Centralizes navigation logic
- Keeps navigation out of views and view models
- Makes screen flow predictable and scalable
- Enables easier refactoring as the app grows

---

## 📦 Model Layer

**Model/**

Contains all domain and data models used across the app:

- **Core models**
  - `Recipe`
  - `RecipeStep`
  - `Ingredient`
- **Classification models**
  - `Category`
  - `IngredientCategory`
- **UI display helpers**
  - `IngredientDisplayItem`
  - `PopularRecipeItem`
- **Network payloads**
  - `RecipePayload`

All models are designed to be:

- Codable / Decodable
- Compatible with both real API responses and local JSON

---

## 🌐 Network Layer

**RecipeApp/Network/**

- Designed for real-time API requests
- Supports:
  - Configurable endpoints
  - Query parameters
  - Headers
- Abstracted via protocols to support swapping implementations

### 🧪 Mock Network Support

Although the network layer is production-ready, the project includes:

- `MockNetworkService`
- Reads from `recipes.json`
- Enables:
  - Offline development
  - Predictable data
  - Faster UI iteration without backend dependency

The mock and real network services are interchangeable via **dependency injection**.

---

## 🧰 Service Layer

**RecipeApp/Service/**

- Handles business logic
- Orchestrates data between Network and ViewModels
- Keeps ViewModels lightweight and focused on presentation logic

---

## 🖼 View Layer

**RecipeApp/View/**

Contains all SwiftUI views:

- Recipe lists and detail screens
- Search and filtering UI
- Reusable components:
  - Recipe cards
  - Ingredient cards
  - Search fields

Views are:

- Stateless
- Driven entirely by ViewModels
- Easy to preview and reuse

---

## 🧠 ViewModel Layer

**RecipeApp/ViewModel/**

- Implements MVVM pattern
- Manages:
  - UI state
  - Search logic
  - Filtering and grouping
  - User interactions
- Communicates only with Services / Network abstractions

### Testability

- ViewModels and data objects are fully testable
- All dependencies are injected
- No hard coupling to concrete network implementations

---

## 🔍 Search Components

Reusable SwiftUI components:

- `AppSearchTextField`
- `SearchBar`
- `SearchField`
- `SearchItemView`

Designed for reuse across multiple screens.

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Current Status

- ❌ Unit tests are not yet implemented
- Test targets already exist:
  - `TestTests`
  - `TestUITests`

### Architecture Readiness

Even though tests are not yet written:

- Models are isolated
- ViewModels use dependency injection
- Network layer is mockable

This makes the codebase ready for unit testing when added.

## 📌 Summary

- ✅ Built with SwiftUI (Xcode 26.2)
- ✅ MVVM + Coordinator architecture
- ✅ Real network layer
- ✅ Load mock response - local JSON
- ✅ Dependency-injected, testable design
- ⏳ Unit tests planned but not yet implemented
